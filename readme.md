## Wins and Blockers

There is no doubt that  the hard part for me in this project was the back-end.
 Comparing to front, which I have more experience with, the server side faced me with a lot of challenges and complexity,some which I never dealt before until  this project: 
- Uploading images to the server and retrieving it to the client using binary codes
- Handling user authentication with tokens and hashing passwords

I'm very proud I managed to implement most of my initial ideas and features but I  wish I had more time to :
- Apply a messaging feature the users can have between them with socket.io.
- Performance improvement, especially with the database queries and the client-side accessibility.
 
Overall, the app is sophisticated and neat. I hope you will like it :)
